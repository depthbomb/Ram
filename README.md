# Cyan.TF Donor Panel

Ram is the name for Cyan.TF's new web-to-game donor panel. The panel gives donors access to features allowing them to send certain commands to the game server from the web.

The panel has its own user database but relies on an existing table in a different database to verify users that log in through Steam.
